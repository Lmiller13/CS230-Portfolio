# CS230-Portfolio
The project that was created here was an application for a drawing game called 'Draw it or Lose it' which was created for the client The Gaming room. 
When documenting the process of development of this game, decisions had to be made about operating platforms, and the structure of the application.
In the documentation I think that a strong suit of my plan was breaking down the pros and cons of different operating systems, and communicating this info to decision makers.
If I could revise on portion of this project it would probably be to go into more depth in the reccomendations for the development of the program.
The customer and end-user had specific needs such as cross platform compatablility and the storage of the data. Without considering all of a customers needs and just designing the project based on the general idea you end up with a much better project and happier customer.
